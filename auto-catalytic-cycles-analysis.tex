\abstract{
    A set of chemical reactions that require a metabolite in order to synthesize excess amount of that metabolite is an autocatalytic cycle.
    We show that most reactions in central carbon metabolism take part in compact autocatalytic cycles.
    Using the most simple form of a metabolic autocatalytic cycle, we derive design principles necessary to enable stable fluxes through such cycles.
    We discuss extensions of the simple model including the effects of external fluxes into the cycle, showing their functional role.
    We find that for stable fluxes through an autocatalytic cycle to occur, the recycling reactions of the cycle must have higher affinity and lower maximal flux than the combined affinity and maximal flux of branching reactions that consume the metabolites of the cycle to generate biomass.
    We find these conditions to hold for functioning autocatalytic cycles in vivo, based on fluxomics and proteomics data.
    These findings imply that stability of autocatalytic cycles limits the affinity of enzymes in the metabolic network and forces excess expression of enzymes that catalyze the reactions consuming metabolites of the cycle.
