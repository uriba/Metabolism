\abstract{
    Autocatalytic cycles are an important part of metabolic networks.
    As the flux through autocatalytic cycles both depends on the concentration of intermediate metabolites and affects it, they present unique features and characteristics.
    We identify a few autocatalytic cycles in central carbon metabolism, some of which are generally not considered as such.
    Using the most simple form of autocatalytic cycle, we derive constraints of stability on kinetic parameters of participating enzymes and show they are also relevant in the general case.
    The constraints we find are that, for stable fluxes through the cycle to occur, the autocatalytic reaction must have higher affinity and lower maximal flux than the reaction diverting metabolites out of the cycle for biomass generation.
    We discuss various extensions of the simple model including different kinetic functions and external fluxes into the cycle.
    We proceed to test these constraints using available experimental measurements in vivo and find them to hold for functioning autocatalytic cycles for which data is available.
    This work thus serves as an approachable introduction to the analysis of autocatalytic metabolic cycles and as a demonstration of the insights one can get by such analysis on real networks.
