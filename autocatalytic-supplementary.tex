    \label{fig:extrasamps}
    Two samples of autocatalytic cycles embedded in central carbon metabolism.
    (I) A cycle assimilating dhap while consuming gap using the reverse fba reaction.
    (II) A cycle assimilating ribose-5-phosphate using the pentose phosphate pathway.
    Both of these cycles contain direct input reactions (dashed lines) allowing the cycle to operate with broader sets of kinetic parameters than cycles missing this feature.
    In both cases, knockout strains where the dashed reactions are eliminated, do not present growth under the relevant carbon source (glycerol in case (I) and ribose in case (II)) despite having the theoretical ability to grow.
