\abstract{
    Auto-catalytic cycles are an important part of metabolic networks.
    As the flux in auto-catalytic cycles both depends on the concentration of intermediate metabolites, and affects it, they present unique features and characteristics.
    We show that even very simple cycles impose specific constraints on the kinetic parameters of the enzymes composing them and their levels, in order to allow stable, non-zero, fluxes.

    We analyze a simple metabolic auto-catalytic cycle, presenting the mathematical tools and techniques needed in order to gain insights about its operation.
    We derive the relationships between two global traits of the cycle: having a non-zero flux steady state, and requiring that the non-zero steady state is stable, and the kinetic parameters of the enzymes forming the cycle.
    We show that the auto-catalytic reaction must have higher affinity and lower maximal flux than the reaction outgoing from the cycle, for stable fluxes through cycle to occur.
    This work thus serves as an approachable introduction to the analysis of auto-catalytic metabolic cycles and as a demonstration of the insights one can get by such analysis.

\section{Introduction}
    Metabolic networks topology and function are limited by numerous constraints.
    Stochiometries must be maintained and reactions must be balanced, reactions sharing the same substrates or products must operate at correct ratios, and the entire metabolic network must be stable under noisy environmental conditions and fluctuations in components levels.
    Auto catalytic cycles present specific challenges as their inherent feed-back nature makes them susceptible to divergence or drainage.
    An understanding of the specific constraints which metabolic auto-catalytic cycles induce is essential for realizing limitations of existing metabolic networks, as well as to successfully modify them in synthetic biology metabolic engineering applications.

    In this work we present the specific requirements auto-catalytic cycles must meet in order to operate: (A) To be able to achieve at least one, non-zero, steady state of fluxes; 
    (B) To be stable for fluctuations at the steady state point(s).
    The mathematical tools we define and use are widely known and applicable in various fields.
    Our analysis demonstrates the use of these tools to gain insights about the operation, limitations, and various modifications available to metabolic auto-catalytic cycles in vivo.
\section{Analysis of a simple auto-catalytic cycle}
    We consider the simple auto-catalytic cycle depicted in Figure \ref{fig:simplecycle}A.
    This cycle has a single intermediate metabolite, $X$, one auto-catalytic reaction with flux $f_a$, such that for any unit of $X$ consumed, it produces two units of $X$, and one outgoing reaction using the cycle substrate with flux $f_b$.
    We assume simple, irreversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the two reactions such that:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      f_a = \frac{V_{\max,a}X}{K_{M,a}+X} \\
      f_b = \frac{V_{\max,b}X}{K_{M,b}+X}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    where all the kinetic parameters are positive.

        (A) A simple auto-catalytic cycle induces two fluxes, $f_a$ and $f_b$ as a function of the concentration of $X$.
        These fluxes follow simple Michaelis Menten kinetics.
        A steady state occurs when $f_a=f_b$, implying that $\dot{X}=0$.
        The cycle always has a steady state at $X=0$.
        The slope of each reaction at $X=0$ is $V_{\max}/K_m$.
        A steady state is stable if at the steady state point $\frac{d\dot{X}}{dX}<0$.
        (B) Each set of kinetic parameters, $V_{\max,a},V_{\max,b},K_{M,a},K_{M,b}$ results in one of four cases (C): 
       (I) there is a stable positive steady state and zero is an unstable steady state; 
       (II) zero is the only non-negative steady state, and it is stable;
       (III) zero is a stable steady state and there is a positive, non-stable steady state; 
       (IV) zero is the only non-negative steady state and it is unstable.}
    \end{figure}

    We characterize the metabolic state of this system by the concentration of the metabolite $X$.
    We note that knowing the concentration of $X$ suffices in order to calculate the fluxes originating from it, $f_a$ and $f_b$, thus fully defining the state of the system.
    A steady state of the system is defined as a concentration, $X^*$, which induces fluxes that keep the concentration steady, such that the total in-flux to $X$ is exactly equal to the total out-flux from it.
    In our example, the outgoing flux from $X$ is $f_a+f_b$ and the incoming flux to $X$ is $2f_a$, so at steady state it holds that:
    \begin{equation*}
      \dot X = \frac{dX}{dt} = 2f_a - (f_a + f_b) = 0
    \end{equation*}

    Expanding this condition we get:
    \begin{equation*}
      \dot X = 0 \Rightarrow f_a = f_b \Rightarrow \frac{V_{\max,a}X}{K_{M,a}+X}=\frac{V_{\max,b}X}{K_{M,b}+X}
    \end{equation*}
    which is satisfied either if $X=0$ or if:
    \begin{equation*}
      X=\frac{V_{\max,b}K_{M,a}-V_{\max,a}K_{M,b}}{V_{\max,a}-V_{\max,b}}
    \end{equation*}
    As physiologically the concentration of $X$ cannot be negative, we get a constraint on the kinetic parameters for which a positive steady state exists:
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{V_{\max,b}K_{M,a}-V_{\max,a}K_{M,b}}{V_{\max,a}-V_{\max,b}}>0 \Rightarrow \frac{\frac{V_{\max,b}}{K_{M,b}}-\frac{V_{\max,a}}{K_{M,a}}}{V_{\max,a}-V_{\max,b}}>0
    \end{equation*}
    The constraint states that if $V_{\max,a}>V_{\max,b}$ then it must be that $\frac{V_{\max,b}}{K_{M,b}}>\frac{V_{\max,a}}{K_{M,a}}$ and that if $V_{\max,a}<V_{\max,b}$ then $\frac{V_{\max,b}}{K_{M,b}}<\frac{V_{\max,a}}{K_{M,a}}$.
    As $\frac{V_{\max}}{K_m}$ is the slope of the Michaelis Menten function at $X=0$, the constraint implies that in order for a positive steady state to exist, the reaction with higher maximal flux must have a shallower slope at $X=0$.
    This condition can be intuitively understood as the reaction with shallower slope at $X=0$ has smaller fluxes for small values of $X$, compared with the other reaction, so unless it has higher fluxes than the other reaction for large values of $X$ (meaning that its maximal flux is higher), the two will not intersect.
    This constraint is graphically illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:simplecycle}B where cases (II) and (IV) have no non-zero steady state, and cases (I) and (III) have a non-zero steady state.

    While having a non-zero concentration steady state is an essential condition to sustain flux, it is not sufficient.
    The non-zero concentration steady state must also be stable to small perturbations.
    Stability with respect to small perturbations is determined by the response of the system to small deviations from the steady state, $X^*$.
    Mathematically, stability dictates that at $X=X^*$ it holds that $\frac{d\dot X}{dX} <0$, as this  implies that for points with a small deviation from the steady state: $X = X^*+\Delta X$ the net flux $\dot X$ will oppose the direction of the deviation.
    If $\Delta X$ is positive then $\dot X$ will be negative at $X^*+\Delta X$, reducing $X$ back to $X^*$, and if $\Delta X$ is negative, $\dot X$ will be positive, increasing $X$ back to $X^*$.

    For the simple kinetics we chose the stability condition requires:
    \begin{equation*}
      \frac{d\dot X}{dX}\Big\vert_{X^*} = \frac{V_{\max,a}K_{M,a}}{(K_{M,a}+X^*)^2}-\frac{V_{\max,b}K_{M,b}}{(K_{M,b}+X^*)^2}<0
    \end{equation*}
    Substituting for $X^*=0$ gives that $0$ is a stable steady state point if $\frac{V_{\max,a}}{K_{M,a}}<\frac{V_{\max,b}}{K_{M,b}}$ (corresponding to the area below the diagonal in figure \ref{fig:simplecycle}B, where $\frac{V_{\max,b}}{V_{\max,a}}>\frac{K_{M,b}}{K_{M,a}}$ resulting in cases (II) and (III)) and is unstable otherwise.
    For  the non-zero steady state, $X^*=\frac{V_{\max,b}K_{M,a}-V_{\max,a}K_{M,b}}{V_{\max,a}-V_{\max,b}}$, we get the opposite condition, i.e. that it is stable if $\frac{V_{\max,b}}{V_{\max,a}}<\frac{K_{M,b}}{K_{M,a}}$ and unstable otherwise.
    
    The complete analysis is summed up in Figure \ref{fig:simplecycle}B.
    Domains (I) and (III) represent cases where a non-zero steady state point exists.
    The domains below the diagonal represent cases where $X^*=0$ is a stable steady state point, and the other steady state, if it exists is unstable (cases (II) and (III)).
    The domains above the diagonal represent cases where $X^*=0$ is an unstable steady state point, and the other steady state, if it exists is stable (cases (I) and (IV)).
    

    To conclude, for this simple cycle, we get that in order for a positive-concentration stable steady state to exist, two conditions must be satisfied:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
      & V_{\max,b}>V_{\max,a} \text{ and,}\\
      & \frac{V_{\max,a}}{K_{M,a}}>\frac{V_{\max,b}}{K_{M,b}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    Meaning that for high enough a concentration of $X$ the biomass generating flux should be higher than the autocatalytic flux, ensuring stability, and that at zero concentration of $X$, the slope of the autocatalytic reaction is steeper than the slope of the biomass generating reaction, ensuring that the two fluxes will be equal at some positive concentration of $X$.

    Interestingly, these conditions imply that if $K_{M,b}<K_{M,a}$ then no positive stable steady state can be achieved, even when allowing changes to the expression levels of the enzymes catalyzing $f_a$ and $f_b$, which only affect $V_{\max,a}$ and $V_{\max,b}$.
    
\subsection{Input flux increases the range of parameters for which a stable steady state solution exists}
    Real auto-catalytic cycles are not stand-alone constructs and specifically, such cycles generally have some feuling reactions with input flux to their intermediate metabolite.
    When adding a constant input flux, $f_i$ to our simple system (Figure \ref{fig:inputcycle}A) the steady state condition changes to include this flux, giving:
    \begin{equation*}
      \dot X = \frac{dX}{dt} = f_i + f_a - f_b = 0
    \end{equation*}
    In this model, at $X=0$, $\dot X=f_i>0$ so the concentration of $X$ increases and there is no steady state at zero.
    If $V_{\max,b}>f_i+V_{\max,a}$ then at large enough value of $X$, $\dot X$ will be negative, implying that at some value of $X$ between these two extremes $\dot{X}$ attains the value of zero, such that under this condition a positive stable steady state point exists (Figure \ref{fig:inputcycle} (I)).
    This case therefore differs from the case with no input flux analyzed above, as now a positive stable steady state can always be achieved by modifying only $V_{\max,a}$ and/or $V_{\max,b}$.
    In this setup cells can therefore tune the expression levels of enzymes to meet the needs of a stable steady state flux.

    In cases where $V_{\max,b}<f_i+V_{\max,a}$ either no steady states exist (Figure \ref{fig:inputcycle} (II)), or two positive steady states exist (Figure \ref{fig:inputcycle} (III)).
    The latter case implies that there exists a positive concentration $X$ that satisfies:
    \begin{equation*}
        \dot X = 0 \Rightarrow f_i + f_a(X) - f_b(X) = 0 \Rightarrow f_i+\frac{V_{\max,a}X}{K_{M,a}+X} = \frac{V_{\max,b}X}{K_{M,b}+X}
    \end{equation*}
  In this case, the lower concentration steady state will be stable.
