  abstract = "Biochemical network reconstructions have become popular tools in
              systems biology. Metabolicnetwork reconstructions are
              biochemically, genetically, and genomically (BiGG) structured
              databases of biochemical reactions and metabolites. They contain
              information such as exact reaction stoichiometry, reaction
              reversibility, and the relationships between genes, proteins, and
              reactions. Network reconstructions have been used extensively to
              study the phenotypic behavior of wild-type and mutant stains
              under a variety of conditions, linking genotypes with phenotypes.
              Such phenotypic simulations have allowed for the prediction of
              growth after genetic manipulations, prediction of growth
              phenotypes after adaptive evolution, and prediction of essential
              genes. Additionally, because network reconstructions are organism
              specific, they can be used to understand differences between
              organisms of species in a functional context.There are different
              types of reconstructions representing various types of biological
              networks (metabolic, regulatory, transcription/translation). This
              chapter serves as an introduction to metabolic and regulatory
              network reconstructions and models and gives a complete
              description of the core Escherichia coli metabolic model. This
              model can be analyzed in any computational format (such as MATLAB
              or Mathematica) based on the information given in this chapter.
              The core E. coli model is a small-scale model that can be used
              for educational purposes. It is meant to be used by senior
              undergraduate and first-year graduate students learning about
              constraint-based modeling and systems biology. This model has
              enough reactions and pathways to enable interesting and
              insightful calculations, but it is also simple enough that the
              results of such calculations can be understoodeasily.",

              metabolism allow a cell to adapt to the changing environment. A
              primary challenge in cell physiology is to identify which of
              these molecular-level changes are active regulatory events. Here,
              we introduce pseudo-transition analysis, an approach that uses
              multiple steady-state observations of 13C-resolved fluxes,
              metabolites, and transcripts to infer which regulatory events
              drive metabolic adaptations following environmental transitions.
              Pseudo-transition analysis recapitulates known biology and
              identifies an unexpectedly sparse, transition-dependent
              regulatory landscape: typically a handful of regulatory events
              drive adaptation between carbon sources, with transcription
              mainly regulating TCA cycle flux and reactants regulating EMP
              pathway flux. We verify these observations using time-resolved
              measurements of the diauxic shift, demonstrating that some
              dynamic transitions can be approximated as monotonic shifts
              between steady-state extremes. Overall, we show that
              pseudo-transition analysis can explore the vast regulatory
              landscape of dynamic transitions using relatively few

                 more chemical A, then A has the power of replication (such
                 systems are known as autocatalytic systems). We provide the
                 first systems-level analysis searching for small-molecular
                 autocatalytic components in the metabolisms of diverse
                 organisms, including an inferred minimal metabolism. RESULTS:
                 We find that intermediary metabolism is invariably
                 autocatalytic for ATP. Furthermore, we provide evidence for
                 the existence of additional, organism-specific autocatalytic
                 metabolites in the forms of coenzymes (NAD+, coenzyme A,
                 tetrahydrofolate, quinones) and sugars. Although the enzymatic
                 reactions of a number of autocatalytic cycles are present in
                 most of the studied organisms, they display obligatorily
                 autocatalytic behavior in a few networks only, hence
                 demonstrating the need for a systems-level approach to
                 identify metabolic replicators embedded in large networks.
                 CONCLUSION: Metabolic replicators are apparently common and
                 potentially both universal and ancestral: without their
                 presence, kick-starting metabolic networks is impossible, even
                 if all enzymes and genes are present in the same cell.
                 Identification of metabolic replicators is also important for
                 attempts to create synthetic cells, as some of these
                 autocatalytic molecules will presumably be needed to be added
                 to the system as, by definition, the system cannot synthesize
                 them without their initial presence.",

                 classes of metabolic cycles using a combination of analytical
                 and computational methods. Using principles from structural
                 kinetic modeling (SKM), we show that the stability of
                 metabolic networks with certain structural regularities can be
                 studied using a combination of analytical and computational
                 techniques. We then apply these techniques to a class of
                 single input, single output metabolic cycles, and find that
                 the cycles are stable under all conditions tested. Next, we
                 extend our analysis to a small autocatalytic cycle, and
                 determine parameter regimes within which the cycle is very
                 likely to be stable. We demonstrate that analytical methods
                 can be used to understand the relationship between kinetic
                 parameters and stability, and that results from these
                 analytical methods can be confirmed with computational
                 experiments. In addition, our results suggest that elevated
                 metabolite concentrations and certain crucial saturation
                 parameters can strongly affect the stability of the entire
                 metabolic cycle. We discuss our results in light of the
                 possibility that evolutionary forces may select for metabolic
                 network topologies with a high intrinsic probability of being
                 stable. Furthermore, our conclusions support the hypothesis
                 that certain types of metabolic cycles may have played a role

                 functions in living cells, including energy transduction and
                 building block biosynthesis. While these are the best
                 characterized networks in living systems, understanding their
                 evolutionary history and complex wiring constitutes one of the
                 most fascinating open questions in biology, intimately related
                 to the enigma of life's origin itself. Is the evolution of
                 metabolism subject to general principles, beyond the
                 unpredictable accumulation of multiple historical accidents?
                 Here we search for such principles by applying to an
                 artificial chemical universe some of the methodologies
                 developed for the study of genome scale models of cellular
                 metabolism. In particular, we use metabolic flux
                 constraint-based models to exhaustively search for artificial
                 chemistry pathways that can optimally perform an array of
                 elementary metabolic functions. Despite the simplicity of the
                 model employed, we find that the ensuing pathways display a
                 surprisingly rich set of properties, including the existence
                 of autocatalytic cycles and hierarchical modules, the
                 appearance of universally preferable metabolites and
                 reactions, and a logarithmic trend of pathway length as a
                 function of input/output molecule size. Some of these
                 properties can be derived analytically, borrowing methods
                 previously used in cryptography. In addition, by mapping
                 biochemical networks onto a simplified carbon atom reaction
                 backbone, we find that properties similar to those predicted
                 for the artificial chemistry hold also for real metabolic
                 networks. These findings suggest that optimality principles
                 and arithmetic simplicity might lie beneath some aspects of
                 biochemical complexity.",

We found that the global pattern of transcription in steady-state cultures in limiting phosphate or sulfate is essentially identical to that of batch cultures growing in the same medium just before the limiting nutrient is completely exhausted. The massive stress response and complete arrest of the cell cycle that occurs when nutrients are fully exhausted in batch cultures is not observed in the chemostat, indicating that the cells in the chemostat are poor, not starving. Similar comparisons using leucine or uracil auxotrophs limited on leucine or uracil again showed patterns of gene expression in steady-state closely resembling those of corresponding batch cultures just before they exhaust the nutrient. Although there is also a strong stress response in the auxotrophic batch cultures, cell cycle arrest, if it occurs at all, is much less uniform. Many of the differences among the patterns of gene expression between the four nutrient limitations are interpretable in light of known involvement of the genes in stress responses or in the regulation or execution of particular metabolic pathways appropriate to the limiting nutrient. We conclude that cells adjust their growth rate to nutrient availability and maintain homeostasis in the same way in batch and steady state conditions; cells in steady-state cultures are in a physiological condition normally encountered in batch cultures.},

The expression of more than one quarter of all yeast genes is linearly correlated with growth rate, independent of the limiting nutrient. The subset of negatively growth-correlated genes is most enriched for peroxisomal functions, whereas positively correlated genes mainly encode ribosomal functions. Many (not all) genes associated with stress response are strongly correlated with growth rate, as are genes that are periodically expressed under conditions of metabolic cycling. We confirmed a linear relationship between growth rate and the fraction of the cell population in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase, independent of limiting nutrient. Cultures limited by auxotrophic requirements wasted excess glucose, whereas those limited on phosphate, sulfate, or ammonia did not; this phenomenon (reminiscent of the Warburg effect in cancer cells) was confirmed in batch cultures. Using an aggregate of gene expression values, we predict (in both continuous and batch cultures) an instantaneous growth rate. This concept is useful in interpreting the system-level connections among growth rate, metabolism, stress, and the cell cycle.},

  abstract    = "Most proteins show changes in level across growth conditions.
                 Many of these changes seem to be coordinated with the specific
                 growth rate rather than the growth environment or the protein
                 function. Although cellular growth rates, gene expression
                 levels and gene regulation have been at the center of
                 biological research for decades, there are only a few models
                 giving a base line prediction of the dependence of the
                 proteome fraction occupied by a gene with the specific growth
                 rate. We present a simple model that predicts a widely
                 coordinated increase in the fraction of many proteins out of
                 the proteome, proportionally with the growth rate. The model
                 reveals how passive redistribution of resources, due to active
                 regulation of only a few proteins, can have proteome wide
                 effects that are quantitatively predictable. Our model
                 provides a potential explanation for why and how such a
                 coordinated response of a large fraction of the proteome to
                 the specific growth rate arises under different environmental
                 conditions. The simplicity of our model can also be useful by
                 serving as a baseline null hypothesis in the search for active
                 regulation. We exemplify the usage of the model by analyzing
                 the relationship between growth rate and proteome composition
                 for the model microorganism E.coli as reflected in recent
                 proteomics data sets spanning various growth conditions. We
                 find that the fraction out of the proteome of a large number
                 of proteins, and from different cellular processes, increases
                 proportionally with the growth rate. Notably, ribosomal
                 proteins, which have been previously reported to increase in
                 fraction with growth rate, are only a small part of this group
                 of proteins. We suggest that, although the fractions of many
                 proteins change with the growth rate, such changes may be
                 partially driven by a global effect, not necessarily requiring
                 specific cellular control mechanisms.",

Given that a cell undergoing steady growth is constrained to sustain each of its internal components, the abundance of all the components in the cell has to be roughly doubled during each cell division event. From this steady-growth constraint, expression of all genes is shown to change along a one-parameter curve in the state space in response to the environmental stress. This leads to a global relationship that governs the cellular state: By considering a relatively moderate change around a steady state, logarithmic changes in expression are shown to be proportional across all genes, upon alteration of stress strength, with the proportionality coefficient given by the change in the growth rate of the cell. This theory is confirmed by transcriptome analysis of Escherichia Coli in response to several stresses.},

However, we detect a significant subset of proteins (∼15{\%}) in both yeasts that are turned over rapidly. In addition, the relative abundances of orthologous proteins between the two yeasts are highly conserved across the 400 million years of evolution.

Separation of the proteins was carried out by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This catalog of proteins, combined with 50 additional ribosomal proteins already studied, comprises about 5\% of the coding capacity of the genome, but accounts for two thirds of the cell's protein mass. The behavior of most of these proteins could be described by a relatively small number of patterns. 102 of the 140 proteins exhibited nearly linear variations with growth rate. The remaining 38 proteins exhibited levels which seemed to depend more on the chemical nature of the medium than on growth rate. Proteins, including the ribosomal proteins, that increase in amount with increasing growth rate account for 20\% of total cell protein by weight during growth on acetate, 32\% on glucose-minimal medium and 55\% on glucose-rich medium. Proteins with invariant levels in the various media comprise about 4\% of the cell's total protein.},

@article{Regenberg2006,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth rate is central to the development of cells in all organisms. However, little is known about the impact of changing growth rates. We used continuous cultures to control growth rate and studied the transcriptional program of the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with generation times varying between 2 and 35 hours. RESULTS: A total of 5930 transcripts were identified at the different growth rates studied. Consensus clustering of these revealed that half of all yeast genes are affected by the specific growth rate, and that the changes are similar to those found when cells are exposed to different types of stress (>80\% overlap). Genes with decreased transcript levels in response to faster growth are largely of unknown function (>50\%) whereas genes with increased transcript levels are involved in macromolecular biosynthesis such as those that encode ribosomal proteins. This group also covers most targets of the transcriptional activator RAP1, which is also known to be involved in replication. A positive correlation between the location of replication origins and the location of growth-regulated genes suggests a role for replication in growth rate regulation. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the cellular growth rate has great influence on transcriptional regulation. This, in turn, implies that one should be cautious when comparing mutants with different growth rates. Our findings also indicate that much of the regulation is coordinated via the chromosomal location of the affected genes, which may be valuable information for the control of heterologous gene expression in metabolic engineering.},

  abstract = {Physiological changes that result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for Escherichia coli allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.},

abstract = {Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host-circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.},

We present a model-based approach to distinguish between these two effects using time-resolved measurements of promoter activities. We demonstrate the strength of the approach by analyzing a circuit involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism in E. coli. Our results show that the transcriptional response of the network is controlled by the physiological state of the cell and the signaling metabolite cyclic AMP (cAMP). The absence of a strong regulatory effect of transcription factors suggests that they are not the main coordinators of gene expression changes during growth transitions, but rather that they complement the effect of global physiological control mechanisms. This change of perspective has important consequences for the interpretation of transcriptome data and the design of biological networks in biotechnology and synthetic biology.},

Here, we investigate the origin of these growth laws by analyzing the features of ribosomal regulation that coordinate proteome-wide expression changes with cell growth in a variety of nutrient conditions in the model organism Escherichia coli. We identify supply-driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation.

  abstract = {Regulation levels of the gene expression cascade controlling protein levels and metabolic fluxes for cells to achieve faster growth have not been elaborated in acceptable detail. Furthermore, there is need for specific growth rate ($\mu$) dependent absolute quantitative transcriptome and proteome data to understand the molecular relationships for enabling cells to modify $\mu$. We address these questions, for the first time, by presenting regulatory strategies for more efficient metabolism of Escherichia coli at higher $\mu$ by statistical covariance analysis of genome-wide intracellular mRNA and protein concentrations coupled to metabolic flux analysis in the steady state range of $\mu$ = 0.11-0.49 h(-1). Our analyses show dominating post-transcriptional control of protein abundances and post-translational control of flux rates. On average, E. coli achieved five-times faster growth through 3.7-fold increase of apparent catalytic rates of enzymes (kapp) and 2.5-fold increased translation rates, demonstrating the relevance of post-translational regulation for increasing flux throughput. Interestingly, pathways carrying the highest flux showed both high protein abundance and kapp values. Furthermore, co-regulation analysis of enzymatic capacities revealed tightly coupled regulatory dependencies of protein synthesis and RNA precursor synthesis, substrate utilization, biosynthetic and energy generation pathways carrying the highest flux. We also observed metabolic pathway and COG specific protein and metabolic flux control levels, protein expression costs and genome-wide principles for translation efficiency and transcription unit polarity. This work contributes to the much needed quantitative understanding of coordinated gene expression regulation and metabolic flux control. Our findings will also advance modeling and metabolic engineering of industrial strains.},

  abstract = {Bacterial gene expression depends not only on specific regulatory mechanisms, but also on bacterial growth, because important global parameters such as the abundance of RNA polymerases and ribosomes are all growth-rate dependent. Understanding of these global effects is necessary for a quantitative understanding of gene regulation and for the design of synthetic genetic circuits. We find that the observed growth-rate dependence of constitutive gene expression can be explained by a simple model using the measured growth-rate dependence of the relevant cellular parameters. More complex growth dependencies for genetic circuits involving activators, repressors, and feedback control were analyzed and verified experimentally with synthetic circuits. Additional results suggest a feedback mechanism mediated by general growth-dependent effects that does not require explicit gene regulation if the expressed protein affects cell growth. This mechanism can lead to growth bistability and promote the acquisition of important physiological functions such as antibiotic resistance and tolerance (persistence).},

  abstract = {We explored genomic expression patterns in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responding to diverse environmental transitions. DNA microarrays were used to measure changes in transcript levels over time for almost every yeast gene, as cells responded to temperature shocks, hydrogen peroxide, the superoxide-generating drug menadione, the sulfhydryl-oxidizing agent diamide, the disulfide-reducing agent dithiothreitol, hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock, amino acid starvation, nitrogen source depletion, and progression into stationary phase. A large set of genes (approximately 900) showed a similar drastic response to almost all of these environmental changes. Additional features of the genomic responses were specialized for specific conditions. Promoter analysis and subsequent characterization of the responses of mutant strains implicated the transcription factors Yap1p, as well as Msn2p and Msn4p, in mediating specific features of the transcriptional response, while the identification of novel sequence elements provided clues to novel regulators. Physiological themes in the genomic responses to specific environmental stresses provided insights into the effects of those stresses on the cell.},

@article{Gerosa2013,
  abstract = {Gene expression is regulated by specific transcriptional circuits but also by the global expression machinery as a function of growth. Simultaneous specific and global regulation thus constitutes an additional--but often neglected--layer of complexity in gene expression. Here, we develop an experimental-computational approach to dissect specific and global regulation in the bacterium Escherichia coli. By using fluorescent promoter reporters, we show that global regulation is growth rate dependent not only during steady state but also during dynamic changes in growth rate and can be quantified through two promoter-specific parameters. By applying our approach to arginine biosynthesis, we obtain a quantitative understanding of both specific and global regulation that allows accurate prediction of the temporal response to simultaneous perturbations in arginine availability and growth rate. We thereby uncover two principles of joint regulation: (i) specific regulation by repression dominates the transcriptional response during metabolic steady states, largely repressing the biosynthesis genes even when biosynthesis is required and (ii) global regulation sets the maximum promoter activity that is exploited during the transition between steady states.},

@article{Castrillo2007,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell growth underlies many key cellular and developmental processes, yet a limited number of studies have been carried out on cell-growth regulation. Comprehensive studies at the transcriptional, proteomic and metabolic levels under defined controlled conditions are currently lacking. RESULTS: Metabolic control analysis is being exploited in a systems biology study of the eukaryotic cell. Using chemostat culture, we have measured the impact of changes in flux (growth rate) on the transcriptome, proteome, endometabolome and exometabolome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each functional genomic level shows clear growth-rate-associated trends and discriminates between carbon-sufficient and carbon-limited conditions. Genes consistently and significantly upregulated with increasing growth rate are frequently essential and encode evolutionarily conserved proteins of known function that participate in many protein-protein interactions. In contrast, more unknown, and fewer essential, genes are downregulated with increasing growth rate; their protein products rarely interact with one another. A large proportion of yeast genes under positive growth-rate control share orthologs with other eukaryotes, including humans. Significantly, transcription of genes encoding components of the TOR complex (a major controller of eukaryotic cell growth) is not subject to growth-rate regulation. Moreover, integrative studies reveal the extent and importance of post-transcriptional control, patterns of control of metabolic fluxes at the level of enzyme synthesis, and the relevance of specific enzymatic reactions in the control of metabolic fluxes during cell growth. CONCLUSION: This work constitutes a first comprehensive systems biology study on growth-rate control in the eukaryotic cell. The results have direct implications for advanced studies on cell growth, in vivo regulation of metabolic fluxes for comprehensive metabolic engineering, and for the design of genome-scale systems biology models of the eukaryotic cell.},

  abstract = {Most genes change expression levels across conditions, but it is unclear which of these changes represents specific regulation and what determines their quantitative degree. Here, we accurately measured activities ofB900 S. cerevisiae andB1800 E. coli promoters using fluorescent reporters. We show that in both organisms 60{\textendash}90\% of promoters change their expression between conditions by a constant global scaling factor that depends only on the conditions and not on the promoter{'}s identity. Quantifying such global effects allows precise characterization of specific regulation{\textemdash} promoters deviating from the global scale line. These are organized into few functionally related groups that also adhere to scale lines and preserve their relative activities across conditions. Thus, only several scaling factors suffice to accurately describe genome-wide expression profiles across conditions. We present a parameter-free passive resource allocation model that quantitatively accounts for the global scaling factors. It suggests that many changes in expression across conditions result from global effects and not specific regulation, and provides means for quantitative interpretation of expression profiles.

  abstract = {The growth rate-dependent regulation of cell size, ribosomal content, and metabolic efficiency follows a common pattern in unicellular organisms: with increasing growth rates, cell size and ribosomal content increase and a shift to energetically inefficient metabolism takes place. The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

@article{Zaslaver2009,
  abstract = {Cells need to allocate their limited resources to express a wide range of genes. To understand how Escherichia coli partitions its transcriptional resources between its different promoters, we employ a robotic assay using a comprehensive reporter strain library for E. coli to measure promoter activity on a genomic scale at high-temporal resolution and accuracy. This allows continuous tracking of promoter activity as cells change their growth rate from exponential to stationary phase in different media. We find a heavy-tailed distribution of promoter activities, with promoter activities spanning several orders of magnitude. While the shape of the distribution is almost completely independent of the growth conditions, the identity of the promoters expressed at different levels does depend on them. Translation machinery genes, however, keep the same relative expression levels in the distribution across conditions, and their fractional promoter activity tracks growth rate tightly. We present a simple optimization model for resource allocation which suggests that the observed invariant distributions might maximize growth rate. These invariant features of the distribution of promoter activities may suggest design constraints that shape the allocation of transcriptional resources.},

                 various contributions and models relating to the control of
                 rRNA synthesis reported over the last 45 years. The second
                 part describes a systems biology approach to identify the
                 factors and effectors that control the interactions between
                 RNA polymerase and rRNA (rrn) promoters of Escherichia coli
                 bacteria during exponential growth in different media. This
                 analysis is based on measurements of absolute rrn promoter
                 activities as transcripts per minute per promoter in bacterial
                 strains either deficient or proficient in the synthesis of the
                 factor Fis and/or the effector ppGpp. These absolute promoter
                 activities are evaluated in terms of rrn promoter strength
                 (V(max)/K(m)) and free RNA polymerase concentrations. Three
                 major conclusions emerge from this evaluation. First, the rrn
                 promoters are not saturated with RNA polymerase. As a
                 consequence, changes in the concentration of free RNA
                 polymerase contribute to changes in rrn promoter activities.
                 Second, rrn P2 promoter strength is not specifically regulated
                 during exponential growth at different rates; its activity
                 changes only when the concentration of free RNA polymerase
                 changes. Third, the effector ppGpp reduces the strength of the
                 rrn P1 promoter both directly and indirectly by reducing
                 synthesis of the stimulating factor Fis. This control of rrn
                 P1 promoter strength forms part of a larger feedback loop that
                 adjusts the synthesis of ribosomes to the availability of
                 amino acids via amino acid-dependent control of ppGpp
