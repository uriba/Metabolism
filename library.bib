We uncover system-wide proteome allocation, expression regulation and post-translational adaptations.

              metabolism allow a cell to adapt to the changing environment. A
              primary challenge in cell physiology is to identify which of
              these molecular-level changes are active regulatory events. Here,
              we introduce pseudo-transition analysis, an approach that uses
              multiple steady-state observations of 13C-resolved fluxes,
              metabolites, and transcripts to infer which regulatory events
              drive metabolic adaptations following environmental transitions.
              Pseudo-transition analysis recapitulates known biology and
              identifies an unexpectedly sparse, transition-dependent
              regulatory landscape: typically a handful of regulatory events
              drive adaptation between carbon sources, with transcription
              mainly regulating TCA cycle flux and reactants regulating EMP
              pathway flux. We verify these observations using time-resolved
              measurements of the diauxic shift, demonstrating that some
              dynamic transitions can be approximated as monotonic shifts
              between steady-state extremes. Overall, we show that
              pseudo-transition analysis can explore the vast regulatory
              landscape of dynamic transitions using relatively few
              steady-state data, thereby guiding time-consuming,

                 more chemical A, then A has the power of replication (such
                 systems are known as autocatalytic systems). We provide the
                 first systems-level analysis searching for small-molecular
                 autocatalytic components in the metabolisms of diverse
                 organisms, including an inferred minimal metabolism. RESULTS:
                 We find that intermediary metabolism is invariably
                 autocatalytic for ATP. Furthermore, we provide evidence for
                 the existence of additional, organism-specific autocatalytic
                 metabolites in the forms of coenzymes (NAD+, coenzyme A,
                 tetrahydrofolate, quinones) and sugars. Although the enzymatic
                 reactions of a number of autocatalytic cycles are present in
                 most of the studied organisms, they display obligatorily
                 autocatalytic behavior in a few networks only, hence
                 demonstrating the need for a systems-level approach to
                 identify metabolic replicators embedded in large networks.
                 CONCLUSION: Metabolic replicators are apparently common and
                 potentially both universal and ancestral: without their
                 presence, kick-starting metabolic networks is impossible, even
                 if all enzymes and genes are present in the same cell.
                 Identification of metabolic replicators is also important for
                 attempts to create synthetic cells, as some of these
                 autocatalytic molecules will presumably be needed to be added
                 to the system as, by definition, the system cannot synthesize
                 them without their initial presence.",

                 classes of metabolic cycles using a combination of analytical
                 and computational methods. Using principles from structural
                 kinetic modeling (SKM), we show that the stability of
                 metabolic networks with certain structural regularities can be
                 studied using a combination of analytical and computational
                 techniques. We then apply these techniques to a class of
                 single input, single output metabolic cycles, and find that
                 the cycles are stable under all conditions tested. Next, we
                 extend our analysis to a small autocatalytic cycle, and
                 determine parameter regimes within which the cycle is very
                 likely to be stable. We demonstrate that analytical methods
                 can be used to understand the relationship between kinetic
                 parameters and stability, and that results from these
                 analytical methods can be confirmed with computational
                 experiments. In addition, our results suggest that elevated
                 metabolite concentrations and certain crucial saturation
                 parameters can strongly affect the stability of the entire
                 metabolic cycle. We discuss our results in light of the
                 possibility that evolutionary forces may select for metabolic
                 network topologies with a high intrinsic probability of being
                 stable. Furthermore, our conclusions support the hypothesis
                 that certain types of metabolic cycles may have played a role
                 in the development of primitive metabolism despite the absence

                 than one of the five other known pathways of autotrophic CO(2)
                 assimilation. The high CO(2) and (initially) O(2)-free
                 conditions permitted the use of a Rubisco with a high maximum
                 specific reaction rate. As CO(2) decreased and O(2) increased,
                 Rubisco oxygenase activity increased and 2-phosphoglycolate
                 was produced, with the evolution of pathways recycling this

                 composition also selected for Rubiscos with higher CO(2)

                 building block biosynthesis. While these are the best
                 characterized networks in living systems, understanding their
                 evolutionary history and complex wiring constitutes one of the
                 most fascinating open questions in biology, intimately related
                 to the enigma of life's origin itself. Is the evolution of
                 metabolism subject to general principles, beyond the
                 unpredictable accumulation of multiple historical accidents?
                 Here we search for such principles by applying to an
                 artificial chemical universe some of the methodologies
                 developed for the study of genome scale models of cellular
                 metabolism. In particular, we use metabolic flux
                 constraint-based models to exhaustively search for artificial
                 chemistry pathways that can optimally perform an array of
                 elementary metabolic functions. Despite the simplicity of the
                 model employed, we find that the ensuing pathways display a
                 surprisingly rich set of properties, including the existence
                 of autocatalytic cycles and hierarchical modules, the
                 appearance of universally preferable metabolites and
                 reactions, and a logarithmic trend of pathway length as a
                 function of input/output molecule size. Some of these
                 properties can be derived analytically, borrowing methods
                 previously used in cryptography. In addition, by mapping
                 biochemical networks onto a simplified carbon atom reaction
                 backbone, we find that properties similar to those predicted
                 for the artificial chemistry hold also for real metabolic
                 networks. These findings suggest that optimality principles
                 and arithmetic simplicity might lie beneath some aspects of
